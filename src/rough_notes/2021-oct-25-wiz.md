I have plans to create a static site generator (SSG) for learning and fun.
**The main purpose** of any static site generator is to pick user written md (or other format files) and create a website out of it.
A static site generator is actually 2 projects 1:: A task runner (TR) 2:: SSG built on top of TR

## What Expectations I have
--- 
### A Tool for My Self (The TR part)
- First of all I need this tool for my self. I want this to be a replacement of Gulp or any other task runner.
- There are many tasks that I want to be automated, this task can help me in that.
- I may like to compile (concat) files based on some features etc
- If i create a command line tool that has 50 something useful commands how great will be that (just like gulp).

### The SSG Part
- Keep in mind that this is for learning purpose.
> **If you end up using your own created tools daily there is no bigger success for a software than that**
- It should be very easy to use out of box (must have a default setup) but then must be able to be customized to any level.

> So finally I am starting with a Gulp in Rust (*first*)
