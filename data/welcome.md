# Welcome to My Rust Book

In the Name of Allah Most Merciful.
-   I have started writing about Rust Programming language and intend to continue this project for a long time.
-   Consider my notes as a **quick and dirty -- but -- detailed** sort of a work. I expect there to be many mistakes and errors and hope that you will bring them to my attention.
- There are rough notes which are like scrambling, please dont waste your time on those.
- God bless you.
