# Rust Documentation

1. The standard Rust distribution ships with a tool called **rustdoc**. Its job is to generate documentation for Rust projects. On a fundamental level, Rustdoc takes as an argument either a crate root or a Markdown file, and produces HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. We can use three forward slashes to write comments that will be included into documentation **///**.
