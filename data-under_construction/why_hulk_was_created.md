## Why Hulk was Created
###### 2021-Nov-08

Every person (technical or no technical) should be able to create great static web sites and host it for free on github in a matter of minutes. All the tools that we need for this are available, they just need to be packaged properly.

> Creating static websites should be a skill available to every one not just web-developers.

I assume that the availability of free hosting for static websites is going to increase. There are many plateforms (github being one of them) which provide unlimited free hosting for static websites. *Youtube is hosting our videos free of cost for years so this increase of free hosting for static websites should not be a surprise.*

I assume that in future there will be more need for **ultra simple static site generators** which can be used by any one and not just web-developers. People like students, lawyers, professionals, hobbists, reserchers , educationists etc will be publishing a lot of content online.

I assume that in future a lot of offline and online documents are going to convert to static sites i.e md and html file format. Documents like  school and college notes , lectures , technical papers , documentation, some publications, advertisements, reserch etc. *It is much easier to send a web link rather than sending some one a pdf*.

## Mission Statement for Hulk

1. **To create a tool that any person can learn with in 5 to 15 min and should be able to benefit from for the rest of his life**.

2.  **Easy but customizable** : *Hulk should be as easy to use as ABC ; at the same time should lend itsself to as much customization as possible*. Both of these objectives may not be achieveable at the same time so preference will always go to ease of use.

3. **Support, Stability and Usability** : The emphasis will be on long term support, stability and usability rather than on bells and whistles . Hulk should be available, maintained and supported for long term. More emphasis will be on making the existing features better rather than adding more features.

4. **The Spirit of inovation** : Other avialble tools which can add value to Hulk will be used and benefited from.
