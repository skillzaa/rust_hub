# Closure and other stuff

 What I dont understand ?

1. where we use closures ? some examples of useful closures usage, also practice sending and recieveing closures from functions.
2. Using map , filter and iterators.
3. Read about Debug triat and other such traits to understand how they are implemented in std library.

Iterator trait has 70 something methods and all you need to do is implement one (next).
The iterator trait is at its base a glorified for loop. The one who made the type also implements the for loop for that type in form of **next** method when he implements the Iterator trait. 
*The next function has code for a "for loop" for a type*.
When we loop through an Iterator it has to *change its internal state* to keep track of the count, for this purpose when an Iterator has reached to its end we discard it (consider it consumed) and get a new one. We do not want to send and recieve Iterators with different internal states.
> The big thing is that once you implement next method you also get some 70 other methods free
