> What is the main idea behind hulk?

- It is a static site generator which can be used by geeks as well as non geeks. People should be able to manage their documents and web-sites easily.
- In addition to being a SSG it will have other useful functions like


## Features
    ### Basic Static Site Generation
        - Create html website from md files in a folder. 
        - For this it needs to copy the directory structure and then copy files exectly the way it has been placed in the data folder.
        - The all other files (html,css all) will be copied just like that.
        - The md files will be parsed into html.
        - 
    ### Dynamic Menu Creation
        - Based on the directory structure it has to create a menu with each of its item pointing to the index.html of each folder (which will be created automatically)
    ### Indexing
        - The next version will automatically generate index file for all the html files just created.
        - initially it will just use the file names and then later we will get data from inside the file.
        - for each folder inside the main folder we need to generate an index file for that folder and the main folder will be linked to that -- a kind of site map feature.
    ### Automatic site map.
    ### tags : The next paragraph is its data.
    ### short codes : simple templates (without variables)
    ### YAML file to configure the app
    ### stats like number of images, etc etc
    ### search
