# Brain Storming Session

### Single Place  
My idea about hulk is that it should be intutive to use. For example if you want to change anything about a file the best place to do so is in the same file. One should not be digging around the entire application to change the behaviour of a single file. If we want to hide a file from being printed we can just set a flat in that file and hulk should hide it for us, there is no need to have seperate file lists placed in various places for different reasons. 
This will need us to insert some meta data inside each file. Next versions of the hulk should have this ability.

<!-- hulk#add -->
### Tagging
- A tag should not be more than 3-5 characters since then we miss spell it at many places. You should have a list of 20 some thing tags that you should use every where. In your tweets , facebook diary etc since most of these applications allow search by tags.
- A suitable list of tags can be as following::
    1. #todo  // some thing that you need to do
    1. #later // to mark incompleted work
    2. @name of a person
    2. #place OR name of a place
    3. #Date in a fixed format e.g 2021-nov-02. Such information can be sorted by date.
    3. #pic //to find all pictures in your documents
    4. #key // can have many different uses.
    4. #hide // can have many different uses.
    4. #show // can have many different uses.
    4. #seek // can have many different uses.
    4. #aim // can have many different uses.
    4. #target // can have many different uses.
    4. #goal // can have many different uses.
    5. #number // some number that has specific meaning for you.
    5. #ser // to give serial number to some thing

### Templating
I see no way for adding templating in hulk without adding a lot of complexity. lets see how it does. For the time being I am content the way hulk is. 
### Simplicity Vs Configuration

> I feel that in order to make Hulk hassle free,easy to use and configuration free; Hulk needs to be a lot Openionated


However I think we can go a long way by just a single config file for the application and by adding *front matter* into files.
