# What is rust-book project about
-   This is an mdBook project.
-   Using mdBook library I have converted my notes into a static website.
-   This website is hosted on [https://skillzaa.github.io/rust_book/](https://skillzaa.github.io/rust_book/). 
- The main project is placed in dropbox for safe custody incase the laptop goes out of order.
- The project is deployed on git hub in [https://github.com/skillzaa/rust_book](https://github.com/skillzaa/rust_book) repository.
----    
-   Following commands are used to compile the project:
    -   After making your changes in the root folder , open terminal and type **mdbook build**.
    - After that you should save the main project to git using **git add** , **git commit** , **git push**.
    - The website part of the project is in the **book** folder on the root. However there is no way to point github to it so I have placed an index.html file on the root that links to the index.html in the **book** folder.
