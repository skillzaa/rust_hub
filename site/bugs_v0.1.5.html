    <h2>Bugs version 0.1.5</h2>
<ol>
<li>Once ./data folder is created it should never be over-written. Only the user can remove files from it manually.</li>
<li>There should never be a panic just accurate messages. There should be some app level error number and appropriate messages with it.Have your own Error object and make it available at app level.</li>
<li>Always over-write the ./site folder before gen since it may have old files remaining in it which has been removed from data folder.</li>
</ol>
