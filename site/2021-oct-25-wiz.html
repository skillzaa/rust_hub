<p>######2021-oct-25</p>
<p>I have plans to create a static site generator (SSG) for learning and fun.
<strong>The main purpose</strong> of any static site generator is to pick user written md (or other format files) and create a website out of it.
A static site generator is actually 2 projects 1:: A task runner (TR) 2:: SSG built on top of TR</p>
<h2>What Expectations I have</h2>
<hr />
<h3>A Tool for My Self (The TR part)</h3>
<ul>
<li>First of all I need this tool for my self. I want this to be a replacement of Gulp or any other task runner.</li>
<li>There are many tasks that I want to be automated, this task can help me in that.</li>
<li>I may like to compile (concat) files based on some features etc</li>
<li>If i create a command line tool that has 50 something useful commands how great will be that (just like gulp).</li>
</ul>
<h3>The SSG Part</h3>
<ul>
<li>Keep in mind that this is for learning purpose.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>If you end up using your own created tools daily there is no bigger success for a software than that</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>It should be very easy to use out of box (must have a default setup) but then must be able to be customized to any level.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>So finally I am starting with a Gulp in Rust (<em>first</em>)
