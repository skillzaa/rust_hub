    <h3>My understanding of multi media programming as of 21-oct-2021</h3>
<p>I spent few hours of reading about multi media programming and found following</p>
<ol>
<li>The old technology (industry standerd) was <strong>OpenGl</strong> and that still stays but is slowly dieing.</li>
<li>OpenGl was extended to be usable in web space as <strong>WebGl</strong>.</li>
<li>OpenGl as well as WebGl both suffered from many problems and there was a need for a new API.</li>
<li><strong>Vulcan</strong> is the new low level API. It is the new thing and is very fast as compared to OpenGl. It provides a lot of power to the user but at the same time it is more complex and more low level than OpenGl.</li>
<li>I think vulcan make use of GPU for processing.</li>
<li><strong>vulkano</strong> is the rust wrapper crate for Vulcan.</li>
<li>Just like WebGl was the web implementation of OpenGl similarly <strong>WebGPU is the web implementation of Vulcan</strong>. So WebGPU is the future of web graphics but is still under experimental flag.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<ol>
<li>For the time being material and tutorials on the Vulcan as well as WebGPU are very less.</li>
<li>It will NOT be a bad idea to try WebGl for a while since its available every where and is not being depricated anytime soon. Also the study material may be available a lot. also the basic techniques are the same.</li>
<li>You must learn Rust and then Webassembly first for that.</li>
</ol>
